Todo App with Riot.js & Redux
=============================

This is a sample of SPA using Riot and Redux. It's structure is similar to
usual React application with Redux. It has reduced boilerplate and action map
object instead of switch based reducer.

This is not production-ready app. I wrote it while learning Riot and Redux.
It's made following videos by
